# 🔐 Password Pwned Checker

A simple Python CLI tool that checks whether your password(s) have been exposed in known data breaches using the [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) API.

## 🛡️ Why Use This?

Data breaches happen frequently, and many passwords become public without users knowing. This tool helps you stay safe by checking if your password has ever appeared in a public breach — **without exposing your actual password** to any server.

It uses **k-Anonymity** via the official Pwned Passwords API to ensure your privacy.
